# NBCU UHD-HDR-SDR "Single-Master" Production Workflow Recommendation & LUTS for Public Distribution

<p>NBCU, in collaboration with Cromorama/Nick Shaw, and building on ITU working group discussions for HDR operational practices involving Dolby, BBC and Philips, has developed techniques to enable “single-master” production that feeds both UHD HDR and SDR transmission simultaneously.</p>
 
<p>The NBCU LUTs developed for this workflow enable single-master UHD production whereby the displayed HDR and SDR products are consistent and the benefits of HDR are still realized making a unified production possible. We’re sharing these efforts with the broadcast community to encourage consistent media exchange and use in UHD and HD production and distribution.</p>
 
<p>The NBCU LUTS include both HLG and PQ LUTs following similar HDR/SDR conversion methodology and color science. There are different LUTs for use in hardware devices, Avid, Premiere, DaVinci Resolve.</p>
  
<p>NBCU has a commitment to industry collaboration and a desire for consistent media exchange, therefore we have decided to provide the NBCU LUTs publicly and freely. The NBCU LUTs are provided on an “as is” basis with no warranties.</p>

<p>In collaboration with MovieLabs, we are also including their LUTs for PQ-to-HLG conversion using the links below.  [For more information from MovieLabs CLICK HERE](https://movielabs.com/distribution-specs/ultra-hd-and-hdr/).</p>

<p>We have recently added new ICC profiles based on ICC.1:2022 (Profile version 4.4.0.0) which allow signaling of HDR and SDR in still graphics</p>

<p>Chris Seeger and Michael Drazin are happy to answer questions pertaining to this effort and provide further insight into workflow.</p>

<p>We ask that manufactures include "NBCU" in the file/conversion name of each LUT and contain an acknowledgment in the license to their customers that the LUTs were “developed by NBCUniversal Media, LLC".  They are distributed publicly and freely without warranty on an “as is” basis in an effort to encourage UHD Single-Master HDR-SDR production with consistent media exchange”.</p>
